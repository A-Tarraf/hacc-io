# Modified HACC-IO
This is a modified version of HACC-IO from [CORAL Benchmarks][coral benchmarks]. 
This project is forked from [Github](https://github.com/glennklockwood/hacc-io?tab=readme-ov-file) and extends the original code

It supports asynchronous MPI-IO and executes the code in loops.

The new file `testHACC_Async_IO.cxxtestHACC_Async_IO.cx` contains several options that can be set:
```c++
	⋮
    int runs = 8; // specify the number of iterations
	⋮
    //**********************************
    //* Options                        *
    //**********************************
    //    rst->DisablePreAllocateFile();

    //? set interface for I/O (read & write)
    //? ******************************************
    //rst->Set_POSIX_IO_Interface();
    //rst->Set_Sync_MPI_IO_Interface();
    rst->Set_Async_MPI_IO_Interface();

    //! sync:  [compute_1][write_1][read_1][verify_1][compute_2][write_2][read_2][verify_2][compute_3][write_3][read_3][verify_3]
    //!
    //! asnyc: [compute_1][write_1][compute_2][write_2] [compute_3][write_3]
    //!                           [read_1]    [verify_1][read_2]   [verify_2][read_3][verify_3]

    //? set Header mode:
    rst->Set_Sync_MPI_IO_Header();
    //rst->Set_Async_MPI_IO_Header();

    //? set File mode
    //? ******************************************
    rst->SetMPIIOSharedFilePointer();
    //rst->SetMPIOIndepFilePointer();
    rst->SetFileDistribution(GLEAN_SINGLE_FILE);
    //rst->SetFileDistribution(GLEAN_FILE_PER_RANK);
	⋮
```

## Running


HACC-IO requires MPI and can be built from the provided makefile via

```bash
	make run MPICXX=mpicxx
```

To use the tracing library [TMIO](https://github.com/tuda-parallel/TMIO/) with the tool, 
TMIO needs to be cloned and the path needs to be adjusted in the Makefile:

```bash
	TMIO_REPO=/d/github/TMIO
```

Afterwards, the code can be executed with different flavors of running the library with the code:
```bash
	# execute the code without TMIO
	make run
	# use LD_PRELOAD with TMIO
	make run_with_lib
	# include TMIO dynamically with msgpack support
	make run_msgpack
	# include TMIO dynamically 
	make run_with_include
	make run_with_include2
	# include TMIO statically 
	make run_with_include_static
```

## Running


The general syntax for `testHACC_IO` is
```bash
    mpirun ./testHACC_IO numparticles /path/to/outputfile
	# or the async version
	mpirun ./testHACC_Async_IO numparticles /path/to/outputfile
	#or 
	make run N=numparticles /path/to/outputfile
```

`numparticles` is the length of the arrays that each MPI rank should allocate.
HACC IO currently uses this parameter to size the following arrays:

variable | type  | size
---------|-------|---------
      xx | float | 4 bytes
      yy | float | 4 bytes
      zz | float | 4 bytes
      vx | float | 4 bytes
      vy | float | 4 bytes
      vz | float | 4 bytes
     phi | float | 4 bytes
     pid | int64 | 8 bytes
    mask | int16 | 2 bytes

So each rank will write out `numparticles` * 38 bytes worth of data.
